# Youtube-Songs-Downloader-using-Python-and-youtube-dl
Download youtube songs from their links with this simple Python code.

Install 'youtube-dl' and 'ffmpeg' first.

Then simply run the python script after putting all your favorite songs' links in the todo.txt file.
Sitback and see your favorite songs getting downloaded.

Note: I've already added some ~130 songs' links in the file, feel free to add more good ones and send a pull.
